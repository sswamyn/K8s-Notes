managing Containers 

In this video, we are going to explore some more commands which can be useful for managing docker containers. Here I have a short list of common commands. Docker ps, for example, we've already seen it. That's a command that you can use to get a list of processes. Then there's docker start, stop and restart, which are commands that closely look like system CTL start, stop and restart commands. You can use it to start and stop and restart a container that has the default application set. There's docker kill, docker kill allows you to terminate a container. And docker rm is removing a container and that is to clean up some disc space. So something else that can be useful is to inspect container settings. You will always start with the docker ps commands, which will show the ID's of the containers and you need to pick one. And next you can use docker inspect followed by the ID to figure out what exactly is happening within the container and you will see many parameters. Next here is docker inspect minus minus format equals something and based on the something you can figure out which setting is used for something specific. Like in this case network settings dot IP address on a container name or ID. And another example is where you can find dot state dot pid and dot state dot pid, that's the pid of the container and that can be useful as well, because that should match the pid that is returned by the ps aux commands. So at this point I do have a couple of containers running so it makes sense using docker ps, there we go, two containers running. Notice the docker ps does not show containers that have been started and stopped already. If you want to see containers that have been started and stopped already, you use docker ps minus a. And I wanted to look at this one. This is the container that was started without a specific process. Now, based on either container name or ID, we can use the docker inspect. So if I type docker inspect on my apache, now we see the properties of the my apache container. Notice how we are doing this. You can use an ID, container ID's are kind of difficult to work with, but they are randomly generated and universally unique. And that's important for the container run time. If you don't specify a name for a container docker automatically generates a name for you. And that is very nice, but sometimes a little bit confusing and for that reason it might be wise to always start your containers with a specific name. Now let's get back to the docker inspect to give you a quick overview of all that is available. As you can see settings, a lot of settings. Also interesting, we see where exactly on the system information about a container is stored, var lib docker containers. That's the directory to keep an eye on because that can become quite big. And then we see well, more settings and going through this, you can find all of the different arguments that are used by the container. And there we go here we have the IP address, for example. And here we have the ports that currently are available which is perfectly explaining what's happening. As you can see ports 80 slash DCP host IP zero zero zero, host port 80 80. This is the port mapping that we have created. And you should be able to discover all properties of your container in this way. Now docker inspect is giving a lot of information and because it is giving such a lot of information, it may be useful to use docker inspect minus minus format, followed by a specific parameter that you are looking for, like network settings dot IP. So here we can see what needs to be done to find the IP address for my apache. There we go, 172 17 0 dot 2. Which by the way, is the default docker IP address range. Another useful example is docker inspect. Another dash dash format equals dot state dot pid, on my apache and that is showing pid 24 3 1. Now, why is this relevant? Well, if you use ps aux and we grab on 24 3 1, we can see that that is the httpd process, in fact. And this httpd process is the process that has been started by the container. So as you have seen, docker inspect is quite important. It's allows you to find all properties of your containers and that can be useful.

 So in this lesson, I want to talk about Container Logging. Container logging is interesting because if something goes wrong then you need to be able to figure out what's happening. And that's a skill that you are going to use in the Kubernetes environment as well. The thing is that logs by default are written to the container, and that means that you don't find them on the host operating system. In the second command, which I will show you shortly. I will show you how you can capture the logs from the container and get them in the host operating system. And then you can just use journalctl. But hey, talking about these bullets makes no sense. Let me just demonstrate. So to start with, I'm using docker run, minus rm the minus rm is for remove. That's an interesting switch because by default images are stored and they are just filling up your disc space. If you don't want that to happen use -rm, which will remove the image once you are done. So -v/dev/log : dev/log, which is doing the mount and I want to use fedora, colon latest, which is the latest fedora image. And next we are using logger with a message, message from, FEDORA. I like the uppercase, which makes it easier to find it. And oops you can see I made a typo. It's docker run, not - Rm it is--rm So you can see the docker run that apparently has done something. And now we need to figure out if we can find it. So journalctl by grep FED will do it. Oops, that's a typo that should be journalctl instead of journalct. And there, you can see that on the host operating system I can see my message from FEDORA and this message from FEDORA is really something that's only logged within the container itself. The logging within the container is not very convenient. And by making the bike Mount of the log device from the container to the DevLog device on the host, you can make sure that you capture all the log messages that are generated on the, on the container and that's convenient
 
  In this video I want to answer the question what is Kubernetes? Well Kubernetes is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling and managing of containerized applications. I didn't find that myself, I got it from the Kubernete's main website https://www.@kubernetes.io. The word Kubernetes itself comes from Greek and it means "pilot of the ship". And what ship is that? Well, that's a ship with containers. Because that is what Kubernetes is, a solution for managing containers. And in this entire video course, you will figure out how it works. By using Kubernetes a new way of doing IT is introduced. And let's go to the lightboard so that I can show you what that means. In this video I want to explain why Kubernetes is so convenient. And in order to do so, let's talk about old IT first. So what, how did it work in old IT? While you remember, you had these servers. And if you wanted to run an application, you would install your application on top of your operating system that runs on the server. Nothing wrong with that but the problem is, if your application was used a lot, you needed to scale it up. How did that work? Well, in old IT you took up your phone and you called the hardware guys and told them, hey, I need a new server. And then they went to the hardware manufacturer to buy you a new server and probably six weeks later, you will be able to create a second server. And on the second server you could run your second application and so on. And then you would put a load balancer on top of that through the network or whatever and probably within two months you will be back in business. That's old IT, how does it work in Kubernetes? Well in Kubernetes we have a cluster of Kubernetes notes and it doesn't really matter how many notes you've got in the cluster, let's say you have three notes. And then on top of Kubernetes, you are going to run your container. Let's call it an application because I don't want to confuse you by using inappropriate terminology. So you would run your application and right now your application is offered by this one note. And then the customers are coming and you need to skill up. Well, that's exactly what Kubernetes is supposed to be doing. You can run a new replica of the application of, on your other notes, you can even do that automatically by monitoring capacity and monitoring that a certain threshold has been best. And in order to access the application, at an application level if anything is skilled up you don't care about it because Kubernetes works with this notion of services. And the service basically is a load balancer and you know what happens if you are scaling up your Kubernetes environment, the surface picks up automatically because Kubernetes is using this amazing feature of labels. So whenever you add a new application and even if you wanted to use a million new applications, all these new applications will use the same label. And because of the same label, your service will automatically connect to all of them. And for the end user point of view, what's the difference? Well, the difference is that the end user will get the capacity that users wanna have when working with your IT. Because don't forget the end user is a customer running to your webshop and who wants an answer within a few seconds. This is how Kubernetes is making sure that that is going smoothly. And whenever you are waiting for a WebShop. to pop up again probably you are talking to this. Let's all go here and I'll teach you how.
  
In this video, I would like to give you a brief impression of Kubernetes Architecture. So we are using the architecture diagram that comes from the Kubernetes website kubernetes.io which is perfectly explaining all of the components that are involved. So Kubernetes as you know, normally is running in a cluster. And in the cluster, we have multiple nodes. The Kubernetes Master also referred to as a Kubernetes controller or head node and the Kubernetes Minions or worker nodes. Let's call them controller and worker nodes. So the controller node is a node that is directing traffic in the cluster. It's the most important part of the Kubernetes cluster. It's like the brains of Kubernetes. And on a controller node, we have four components. The controller manager, the API server, the scheduler, and the HCD. The API server is the part that makes sure that Cuban Eddie's management clients can talk to Cuban Eddie's. This is where the API is defined and this is where the API is interfaced. So this is basically where the commands come in. And based on the commands that come in, there is a kube-scheduler. The kube-scheduler is the part that pushes the workload to a specific worker node to make sure that it can be executed. Now we have the HCD. The HCD is a simple database. It's a key value store. And we have the kube-controller manager, which is controlling the process. Now you can see in this diagram that there's a cloud involved. And that's for a simple reason that many Kubernetes workloads are used in public clouds like AWS or Azure or Google Cloud. And then we have the Kubernetes Minions or the worker nodes themselves. On these worker nodes, we have two components the kubelet and the kube-proxy. The kubelet is basically the Cuban Eddie's agent. When a Cuban Eddie's scheduler is going to schedule a workload somewhere, it is going to be scheduled on a kubelet. And then there is a cube-proxy The cube proxy is used in the communication to make sure that secure end to end communication can happen through REST by the API server and the local nodes. The kube-proxy terminates the TLS connection and it makes sure that the work is going to happen on the worker node and that the different parts of the Kubernetes cluster are accessible. Now for CKAD This is not an extremely important picture but it does help understanding what the big picture looks like before we are going to look at the details.

this lesson is about setting up a lab environment and we are going to use Minikube, but before we do that, I want to sketch the big picture. So here are the different deployment options. Kubernetes can be deployed in many environments. You can run it in public cloud. All public clouds currently support Kubernetes environments. You can run it on-premise in your own data center and that can be either physical servers or virtual servers. And that's convenient if you don't want to use Kubernetes in a public cloud environment for security reasons, for instance. Doing an on-premise install in a data center can be complicated and there's a lot to consider. So that's not what we are going to do in this class. In this class, we are going to use Minikube. Minikube for testing and developing because it's an easy and convenient way to get started where you have the full experience of a closer and still have everything under your control without being charged by the minute. If you want to learn how to set up a Kubernetes cluster using kubedam you can have a look at my upcoming CKA course. Oh, and there is a couple of online solutions as well. So if you want to do a quick online try without installation you can try, for example, the tryk8s.com solution or one of the other on-line platforms. That is nice if you just want to get a first impression of what Kubernetes has to offer. In order to become a CKAD you really need more than try Kubernetes. You need something that you can run in your own environment and that's Minikube. In the next video, I will show you how to set it up

In this video, I will show you how to install Minikube, because we are going to work in a lab environment that uses Minikube. Obviously you are welcome to use your own lab environment. If you have a Kubernetes environment that is running in public cloud or search, go ahead and use it. But all of my examples are based on the Minikube environment. So what do we need? Well, Minikube offers a complete test environment that runs on Linux, OS-X or Windows, so you can run it directly on top of your own preferred operating system. In this course, we'll use Minikube, as it is easy to set up and there's no further dependencies and we are going to install it in a Fedora virtual machine. Apart from that, we need the kubectl client on the management platform as well. In order to set up the lab environment, I am providing a script, and this script is setting up Minikube on top of Fedora. I've only tested the script on Fedora. So use the latest version of Fedora if you want to run my script. You can get access to the script through my GitHub repository. Use the command git clone https://github.com/ sandervanvugt/ckad. I am demonstrating this based on Fedora Workstation 30. If by the time you are using this, a newer version is available, that should work as well. I intend to make sure that the kube setup script is compatible with newer versions as well. This kube set up script will set up Minikube, as well as the kubectl client. And that is to make it easy for you, as I was mentioning. If you want to run Minikube on top of something else, you can also follow the manual procedure that is described in the rest of this lesson. Before we are starting this installation, I want to make a quick sketch of what the configuration looks like. So in this video, I want to give a quick explanation of the configuration that we are using, the working environment that is. So I am on my Mac OS, and on top of my Mac OS, I'm running VMware Fusion myself. And in VMware fusion, I have installed my Fedora machine. So if this is my Fedora 30, the fun thing is that within the Fedora 30, we are going to install virtual box. And on top of the virtual box, we are running the Minikube virtual machine. That's what we call embedded virtualization. And if you think, hey, isn't embedded virtualization bad for performance? Of course it is, but this is not a production environment, this is a demo environment, so it should be doing good enough. I have provided my script, so my kube setup, is running in the Fedora environment. It only works in a Fedora virtual machine that's been developed to be used in that environment. But if you think, hey Sander, I don't like that. I wanna go for a different approach. Well, that's possible because on top of Mac OS, you can also run Minikube. That's a procedure that I have decided not to show you in this class because not everybody is using Mac OS and I don't want to create a 20 different videos telling you how to install a Minikube on Mac OS, on Windows, on CentOS, on Red Hat, on Fedora, on Ubuntu, I think you get the idea. So this is what we are going to do. Let's do it. Alright, so this is my Fedora virtual machine. Let's quickly explore the properties. I've installed a virtual machine with eight gigabytes of RAM, the more the merrier. So if you have sufficient amount of RAM, give it eight gigabytes, it will do on four gigabytes, it can run on two gigabytes as well, but it will be relatively slow. So four gigabytes is minimum. I've configured the system with a 40 gigabyte hard drive, which has given me 35 gigabytes in the root volume, and that's good enough. Also, and this is important for the embedded virtualization, there is virtualization support that is required. So you can verify that by typing grep VMX on proc CPU info. It should give you the VMX flag, and if it does, now you have a virtualization support and you will be good. So, as I've mentioned, I have my GitHub repository, and you should use it to make it easy on yourself. So first you need to install the git client of course. All right, so let me use git clone https://github.com sandervanvugt, ckad. And that will clone to ckad directory in a current directory of this user user. So in the ckad directory, you will find everything that we are going to need in this class, including the kube set up dot SH script. That is a script, by the way, that does require root privileges. So let me open a root cell again. And from there, let's have a look at the script. So here you can see the script. I should update this verified on Fedora 30, 39 is a little bit too much. I just want to give you a quick impression of what this is doing. So we need virtual box to be installed. And in order to do that, we need access to a virtual box repository. As of now, virtual box 5.2 is needed for the setup, so that is what we are going to install next. I'm using a DNF clean all, and a DNF upgrade, which is upgrading all packages. Do note that will take some significant time. And then the next part is where we are going to install a virtual box, virtual box in daemon mode. So a virtual box daemon will be available in the system providing the virtualization. And then it's installing the Kubernetes client, which is in a package, most distributions just offer a package that contains Kubernetes client. And next, we are going to download Minikube. The download procedure for Minikube is similar to many other things that are happening in Kubernetes environments. You are directly fetching the file from Google apis.com. Make sure that you are fetching the latest that will always give you the latest version. And the result is that you have the binary, the Minikube binary, downloaded to the local directory. And from the local directory, you make it executable, your copy, or even move it to user local bin in the path. I have written the script in a way that the script then stops and prompts that you need to manually reboot your machine. I don't like to do that automatically, of course it's possible to do it automatically, but to make sure that no bad things are happening, the script is asking you to do that. And then you manually need to run a vbox config and Minikube start. So I'm going to start the script now. And again, it'll take some time before we get to the moment that it will prompt for the reboot. So I am going to run Kube setup.sh And here we go. All right, well, at this point, we need to reboot as instructed by the script. And after the reboot, we need to use a vbox config to further configure kernel drivers that are used by virtual box. And then we can start Minikube using Minikube start. Before we can do that, let's reboot. So here we are ready to continue. First thing we need to do is vbox config. So I'm using sudo vbox config, because from now on, I don't really need a root shell anymore, but vbox config doesn't require root privileges. And now it's time for the last step, Minikube start. So I'm typing Minikube start, and then a lot of work is going to happen. So we can see it's downloading Minikube V 140. Notice that versions of Minikube change rapidly. So by the time that you are learning this, you are probably using a more recent version of the Minikube. You can be. You can see it's downloading a Minikube ISO, and then it's going to start a Minikube ISO, and the very first time you are starting Minikube, that will take awhile. Count on anything between five and 10 minutes, approximately. So be patient, you will be ready to get started in not too much time. While this is finishing, let's get back to the slides so that I can explain how to set up a Minikube environment manually. So if you want to go through the manual procedure, you will start by installing kubectl manually, and there are different ways that you can use to install it. You can install it from your cloud specific client. So if you are in Google cloud, just open the Google cloud shell, and from there use kubectl. You can also compile it from source or use it directly from the release binaries or use a kubernetes client package from your Linux distribution. I would advise you use either the first or the last option. The options in the middle are way too complicated. Once the kubectl client is installed, you can start the installation of Minikube. The reason you install kubectl before you install Minikube, is when Minikube is installed and it finds a kubectl client, it will create a configuration and automatically connect to your Minikube instance, and that's convenient. Now, in order to install Minikube, you can use virtual box. Minikube runs on top of a hypervisor. Virtual box is common, but it's not the only hypervisor. So if you want to run it on KVM, that's possible. Within that case, please consult the online documentation because I cannot explain all the different options. For the installation of virtual box, there's a couple of dependencies. That's the GCC echelon dependencies, which are required to add the drivers that a virtual box is using to the Linux kernel. You must enable CPU virtualization support. That is typically something that you will do in the bios of your computer or in the properties of your virtualization client program. Next, you need vbox config to be configured because that is going to compel the virtual box drivers into your learning kernel. As we have already seen, you can also make it easy to yourself and use the kube setup script that is provided in the GitHub repository. But assuming that you want to do it yourself after setting up the virtual box layer, you can download Minikube, using the curl command that is right here. Notice that even if it is wrapped over three lines, this is one command. Once you have downloaded the file, you can continue. And that means you are going to make Minikube executable, chmod plus X will do that. Next, you move Minikube to user local bin so that you have it in your local path. And then you can use Minikube start, and notice that this may take over 15 minutes to complete, depending on the speed of your internet connection, of course. Once Minikube is started, you can use kubectl cluster-info to get information and kubectl get nodes, and that should bring you somewhere. Let's go check out what this looks like on our Minikube installation. So as you can see, it's (indistinct) done. Kubectl is now configured to use Minikube, let's verify. First thing I want to do is kubectl cluster info, which is showing information about the current cluster. And this is exactly what I want to see. I see a Kubernetes master is running at specific IP address. The 192.168.99.100 is the default IP address of the Minikube node. We have a kube DNS and to further debug, no, not now, let's just do a kubectl get nodes. And kubectl get nodes is telling us that the master node is ready and that's exactly what I needed. Now in Minikube, there are a couple of commands that can be used. In fact, Minikube dash dash help will show you everything that it accepts as a command line argument, but that's specific about the Minikube environment. So to be honest, most of the things that we see in this list are not really important. The most important things, Minikube stop, which will stop it, Minikube start, which will start it, Minikube status, which will give status, Minikube delete, if ever you want to start from scratch. And we will shortly see Minikube dashboards as well. But for now I want to focus on something else, and that is Minikube SSH. If you use Minikube SSH, the Minikube is opening an SSH session to the Minikube node, and this Minikube node is an interesting node of course. Three minus M is showing that the Minikube node is using two gigabytes of RAM, that's all, and of these two gigabytes of RAM, it has used 531 megabytes, so that's not much. The interesting thing is that if you type docker ps, now you see a lot of Docker processes. Kubernetes consists of multiple components, including the API server, the scheduler, the controller manager, and the fun thing is that all of them are started as containers. Containers are running on top of the docker platform that is presented within the Minikube environment. And that means that you can find these containers using Docker ps or using ps aux, maybe ps aux grep docker to see the docker commands. And these docker commands are useful because they are giving insights in how exactly the Minikube environment is running. And this is definitely a place you want to get back once you have a good generic understanding of kubernetes and everything that is happening, because so many things are happening as a container in the background.
